# Quant GAN


In Jupyter notebook QuantGAN.ipynb Quant GAN from [Wiese et al., Quant GANs: Deep Generation of Financial Time Series, 2019](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.06673) is implemented. The task was performed for the Deep Generative Models course provided by HSE.

## Environment

The model was trained on [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/). It is recommended to train and evaluate the model on Colab too. 
Actual environment requirements could be found in requirements.txt. This file was generated by executing command in Colab:

```bash
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

All the required packages (not provided by Colab) are installed directrly in the notebook. If you try to execute the code on your local machine, you might experience inconvinience. Better execute the code using training platform - Colab. 


## Usage 

### Training

Model is provided in Python, using PyTorch. 

Core classes are `TemporalBlock`, `TCN`, `Generator` and `Discriminator`. 
Data used for training is provided via `SP500Dataset` class.

To perform training go to `Prepare and train GAN` section on the notebook. 


### Generation

To generate the data go to `Probe generation` section on the notebook. Also the subsection `Visualize results` will be helpful to see the results of data generation.
